# Cloud-Based Attendance Monitoring with Facial Recognition and LLM Integration

## Overview
This project is an AI-powered cloud application that automates student tracking using facial recognition and Large Language Models (LLMs). By integrating real-time facial recognition and advanced language models, the system enhances efficiency and accuracy in attendance monitoring.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend:** Flask, MySQL
- **Frontend:** React, Material UI
- **Cloud & AI:** Facial recognition API, LLM integration

## Features
- Automated attendance tracking through facial recognition
- Real-time student monitoring and reporting
- Integration with LLMs for enhanced data processing
- Cloud-based deployment for scalability and accessibility

## Project Structure
- `backend/` - Flask-based backend with MySQL database
- `frontend/` - React application using Material UI for design
- `models/` - AI models for facial recognition and LLM processing
- `docs/` - Documentation and setup guides

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
    clone https://github.com/Shullyson/Cloud-Based-Attendance-Monitoring-with-Facial-Recognition-and-LLM-Integration.git
